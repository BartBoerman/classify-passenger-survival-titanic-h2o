# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
This my entry for the Titanic competition on Kaggle. May 2019: public score is 0.80382, which is a top 10% ranking on the leader board of around 11.249 participants.

I wrote a Python script to automate the following tasks: read data from CSV, perform data wrangling, give a brief data analysis, impute missing values, add predictive value with feature engineering, train stacked ensemble (build with h2o framework) and generate predictions on unseen test data.
